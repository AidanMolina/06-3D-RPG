You will need to have non-player agents (enemies or others) that behave according to a rudimentary AI
You will need to have a dialogue-based conversation with one agent 
You will need to have at least one hand-held item (weapon or other) with which you can interact with the agents and/or the environment
You will need to have a scoring system
Your game must have a clear objective
